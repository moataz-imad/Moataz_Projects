## Introduction

Sarcasm detection is a challenging problem in NLP due to the nuanced nature of sarcastic comments, which often rely on context and tone. This project aims to build a classifier that can accurately identify sarcastic headlines from real ones. This tool can be useful for content filtering, sentiment analysis, and enhancing user experiences in social media platforms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of news headlines labeled as either sarcastic or genuine. It can be found on Kaggle:

[Sarcasm Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `headline`: The headline text.
- `is_sarcastic`: A binary label where `1` indicates sarcasm and `0` indicates a real headline.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcasm-detector.git
   cd sarcasm-detector
