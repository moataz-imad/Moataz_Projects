logo: a personal project that imitates the mathematical side of Wolfram Alpha.

This webpage is developed as the final project for CS50x provided by Harvard University

It uses numerical methods to find the roots of any given expression and plots it over a given range.

Technical Stuff (pop-up):
The frontend of the webpage is designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
the backend is developed using Python, Flask, and Javascript

the numerical method used to find the root was the bisection method (link) 
although it was a powerful way to find the root, it had some disadvantages so I had to develop my own (basic) method of optimizing the sectioning and finding the root.

The graph visual is created with google charts

The most challenging part was finding a way to insert the x,y series into the graph visual using javascript.
