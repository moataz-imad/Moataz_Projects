## Introduction

Managing weather data from multiple sources can be challenging due to discrepancies and inconsistencies. This project addresses this problem by collecting data from FAHU sensors and online weather APIs, cleaning and integrating the data, and providing a single, reliable dataset for future use.

## Data Sources

The project integrates data from the following sources:

1. **FAHU Sensors:** Local sensors providing real-time weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
2. **Internet Weather APIs:** Online sources providing comprehensive weather data.
