## About Me

Highly motivated Data Scientist with more than 4 years of experience leveraging machine learning and data analysis to solve complex business problems. Proven ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and translate data insights into actionable recommendations. Passionate about using data to drive product innovation and business growth. <br>
I have a strong background in **Engineering** and **HVAC Systems**.

## Projects

I have worked on many projects covering multiple fields, from data science to web development. To highlight a few:
- [Machine learning models](python_projects/data_science/chiller_performance_model/) that can predict the performance of chillers:
  - Using XGBoost and random forest models, I was able to predict the performance of chillers based on various features (32 parameters).
  - The project resulted in 13 models that were compared and competed to select a final model, which was used to calculate the savings.
- An [NLP model](python_projects/data_science/sarcasm_detection/) that distinguishes between sarcastic and genuine sentences.
- Various [data analysis](python_projects/data_science/roof_top_unit_analysis/) and [data cleansing](python_projects/data_science/weather_data_cleansing/) projects.
- [Harvard's CS50 Final Project](python_projects/general_projects_and_tools/cs50_final_project_wolfram_beta/), a Flask web application that prompts the user to enter an equation, and then solves and plots the equation.
- Several [Dashboards](https://www.behance.net/gallery/186816123/Power-BI-Dashboards) presented to higher management.
- Many web scraping scripts:
  - [Gas price comparison across the world.](python_projects/general_projects_and_tools/gas_price_comparison/)
  - [Flight ticket price comparison.](python_projects/general_projects_and_tools/flight_ticket_price_web_scraper/)
  - [Automated parking registeration.](python_projects/general_projects_and_tools/automated_visitor_parking_registration/)
  - [Restaurant availability notification.](python_projects/general_projects_and_tools/talabat_restaurant_status/)
